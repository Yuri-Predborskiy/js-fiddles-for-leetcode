# Javascript solutions to LeetCode problems.
This repository contains my JavaScript solutions to LeetCode problems.
If the solution was inspired by a specific solution or external resource, I tried to add a link to the external resource.

### How to use this repository

Every problem has its own folder. You can find the problem either by name or by problem number.
Every solution is written in a separate file.
Some problems have multiple solutions either using a different approach (brute force, optimized etc), or simply written at different times.

### Tests
Practically every file has tests included in the file.
To run the tests simply run the file itself.

### Descriptions, explanations
Many solutions have explanations in the comment at the top of the file.

Some tests require helper functions, which are declared in a helper.js file outside of solution folders.

### Special thanks
Lots of thanks to LeetCode site and community for posting questions and solutions.
Specifically, the Explore section contains a ton of great information with nice practice questions.

Tons of thanks to GeeksForGeeks resource for posting lots of algorithms for certain questions not covered in LeetCode explore section.
Many thanks to everyone who posts their code and explanations in LeetCode discussions.
Extra thanks for taking the extra effort to record videos for solutions! You rock!
